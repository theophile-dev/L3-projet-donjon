### Key aspect of the project

* All the displayed text are handled thanks to the Display which use the Singleton design pattern
because only one instance is ever created. This class make adding new content to display easy, anything that need to be displayed
need to implements the interface displayable.
* The different Direction the player can choose come from an enum which implements Displayable.
* The game mechanics are mainly handled by the different Action subclasses 
* Every Action need to define canPerform, this way only the Actions that can be performed are displayed
